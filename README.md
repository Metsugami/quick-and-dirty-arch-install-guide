# DISCLAIMER
**I am not responsible for any damages, loss of data, system corruption, or any
other mishap you may somehow cause by following this guide.**

This is mainly a step-by-step reminder/log for myself of how I installed Arch on
my laptop. I am putting this out there in case it is useful for someone else, it
is **not** intended to be an official guide. As a result, you may find that this
guide is very tedious or lists a lot of unnecessary/intuitive steps or just
straight up does things in a way that is considered bad practice. Apart from the
latter, this is intentional, as I did not find these steps intuitive at all when
I was doing this, and as such I chose to list _everything_ that I did in case
someone else would need/like a similar level of guidance.

I will try, but I cannot promise that I will keep this guide up-to-date with the
the Arch Wiki. **If you are reading this a couple of months down the line and I
have not updated it in a while, you ~~might~~ will want to check with/refer to
the Arch Wiki either completely or at least in parallel to this guide as
settings/commands/recommendations might have changed.**
